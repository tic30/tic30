### FAQ: 
1. Why is the code in master not human readable?
    
     What you see in master is the production build of React code. I did this to convert React code to static page to be hosted on GitHub Page (with the help of [this library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)).

2. Where is the code?

    In case interested, you can find the code in branch `react-refactor`.
