                    <p>Through fast-paced yet in-detailed research, now our group processes enormous amount of practical data and is finishing up the design of user flow for the entire application. We are ready to face any questions, concerns or challenges from the user and/or stake holder side. As of today, the major tasks for all team members are development oriented problem-solving and optimization. <strong>85%</strong> local implementation is accomplished. We will be ready for migrating our database to cloud-based server very soon. We will coordinate with Siemens IT to finalize the security implementation, testing and distribution preparation before we push the product <strong>globally to all Siemens factory</strong> around the world.

                    <p>The research phase lasted for years. Multiple hardware platforms and software approaches were studied. Multiple prototypes were made and tested. My group went to the shop with our attempted solutions and collected user feedback face-to-face, then came back and studied feasibility for each platform and approach. After we decided the best practical solution, in-detail workflow design and implementation were initiated.

                    <p>Above is a high-level abstraction of the design for user-oriented access customization. We design the tool set to meet practical requirement in the factory by identifying <strong>user groups</strong> and <strong>user roles</strong>(think of it like job title). Doing so also allows us to individually customize the design of workflow, usability for each use case as well as grant user access right accordingly. </p>

                    <p>Great news: All funding is recently approved! The budget is <strong>multi-million dollars</strong>. It is time to sprint wth full-speed as a fully geared team.</p>
                    <p>In current sprint we are working hard to finish implementing the software package and conduct effective testing along the way. I am also working closely with designers in our team to harmonize the interface design and revise some of the usability design. I am confident that by the end of my employment we will be able to deliver and launch a well-designed and fully functional product as planned.</p>
