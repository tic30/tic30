// I seek challenges, with-in and out of work. I embrace them, break them down into practical tasks and improve myself along the way. 
//My efforts in studying user, creating solutions to tackle the real people problem and validating the effectiveness of the solutions through fast iterations of prototyping, testing and optimization form the major chord of my work. 
// As a detail oriented person, I demonstrate front end products that express creative design language with clean and reusable code.
